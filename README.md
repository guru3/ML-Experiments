Trying different things out usually inspired from articles on machine learning topics


##### Unless the machine learning algorithm is hardcoded to look for a specific kind of simple model, parameter learning can sometimes fail to find a simple solution to a simple problem!

##### Generating sequential data is the closest computers get to dreaming

##### Diversity of models is what make ensembling work

##### Hyperparameter optimization is technically a way to overfit validation data
